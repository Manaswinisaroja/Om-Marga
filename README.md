## 🌸 Inspiration  
Our team was driven by a desire to give back to our cultural and spiritual heritage. In a fast-moving digital world, many devotional practices fade away. With OmMarga, we aimed to create a platform that brings spiritual traditions—like chanting, pradakshina, and reading stotras—into a modern, engaging format.

---

## 🙏 What It Does  
OmMarga brings together multiple devotional features in one place:

- 📿 **Japamala Counter** – Count up to 108 beads, track completed malas.  
- ⭕ **Pradakshina Counter** – Track rounds of circumambulation with daily resets.  
- 📚 **Stotra Library** – Read sacred verses in Telugu & English, with search, favorites, and a language switch.  
- 📅 **Panchang / Tithi Info** – Displays today's lunar tithi and suggests an appropriate stotra.  
- 🖼️ **Daily Image / Wallpaper** – A new devotional image each day for inspiration.  

---

## 🛠 How We Built It  
- **Frontend**: Developed using clean HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript with smooth transitions.  
- **Content**: Structured devotional content like stotras, quotes, and Panchang info in JSON files.  
- **State Management**: Used `localStorage` to maintain counters, favorites, theme preference, and other user data.  
- **Logic**: JavaScript handles daily wallpaper rotations (by date or randomly), daily resets, and maintaining app state on reload.

---

## 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into  
- Encoding and displaying stotras in both Telugu and English with elegant formatting.  
- Keeping counters (Japamala and Pradakshina) persistent and resetting them daily without bugs.  
- Designing a clean, intuitive UI that balances modern aesthetics with devotional simplicity.  
- Structuring JSON data for efficient access while keeping it easy to extend.

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments That We’re Proud Of  
- Successfully creating a minimalist yet feature-rich devotional platform.  
- Ensuring full offline capability and data persistence through `localStorage`.  
- Designing an interface that even new users can navigate without friction.  
- Staying faithful to our mission: merging cultural tradition with accessible technology.

---

## 📖 What We Learned  
- The power of `localStorage` for seamless, client-side persistence.  
- Structuring complex devotional content using JSON effectively.  
- Designing a devotional-first user experience blending simplicity and functionality.  
- Implementing smooth UI transitions and daily logic flows in JavaScript.

---

## 🚀 What's Next for OmMarga  
- Add **audio playback** for stotras for users who prefer listening.  
- Implement **multi-language support** beyond Telugu & English.  
- Expand the **Stotra Library** via community contributions.  
- Develop **Android/iOS versions** to reach mobile users.
